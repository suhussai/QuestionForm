                        Dialysis is a medical treatment that does some of the kidneys’ work to remove toxins and water from your body. It will not cure kidney disease or stop kidneys from getting worse. Dialysis will not treat other medical problems like diabetes or heart conditions. It requires a great deal of time and effort. Patients’ experiences vary widely. In general, the healthier you are, the more likely you are to find it helpful. There are two main types of dialysis.

                          Peritoneal dialysis needs to be done <strong><em>every</em></strong> day. The procedure takes 30-60 minutes and is done 4 times a day. You can also do it overnight while you sleep (8-10 hours) by using a machine. &nbsp;You can fit the dialysis around your personal schedule.
